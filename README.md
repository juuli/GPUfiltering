GPU filtering
============
This is a sandbox for GPU based filter 
prototyping. The implemented began as a part of 
the Aalto university cousrce
 S-89.3580 Audio Signal Processing Seminar

The source dependencies can be seem from the CMake
file, but the list is quite short:
- Boost Libraries
- Port Audio
- Cuda 4.2

To compile, I used cmake 2.8
